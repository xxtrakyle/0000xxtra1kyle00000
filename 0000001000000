You can use the ps command along with grep and awk to achieve this. Here's how:

ps -eo pid,etime,cmd | grep -v '00:00:00' | awk '{elapsed_hours = int($2/3600); if (elapsed_hours > 1) {print $0}}'
Explanation:

ps -eo pid,etime,cmd: This part uses ps to list processes with specific information.
-e: Show processes from all users.
o: Specify the output format.
pid: Process ID.
etime: Elapsed time since the process started (in HH:MM:SS format).
cmd: Command name including arguments.
grep -v '00:00:00': This part filters out processes with an elapsed time of exactly zero hours (processes that just started).
awk '{elapsed_hours = int($2/3600); if (elapsed_hours > 1) {print $0}}': This part uses awk to further process the output:
$2: This refers to the second column, which is the elapsed time.
int($2/3600): This calculates the elapsed time in hours by dividing the total seconds by 3600.
if (elapsed_hours > 1): This checks if the elapsed hours are greater than 1.
print $0: If the condition is met, the entire line (process information) is printed.
